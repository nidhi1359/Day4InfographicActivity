    <b>Did you know that "rocks" are actually composed of
        many different minerals?
        
        <p>There are many different minerals, such as quartz (milky, rosy,
        and smoky) and feldspar.</p>
        
        <p>There are many various rocks, which fall into 3 categories:
        sedimentary,metamorphic, and igneous rocks. Sedimentary rocks
        are formed through lithification (a term describing the deposition,
        compaction, and cementation of sediments and silt over a long
        period of time). Metamorphic rocks are formed when (preexisting)
        rocks (called protoliths) are transformed through heat, pressure, 
        and/or reactive fluids. Finally, igneous rocks are formed when
        magma (molten rock beneath the earth's surface) rises to the
        surface and cools.</p>

        <p> Here are some pictures of rocks and minerals.</p>
